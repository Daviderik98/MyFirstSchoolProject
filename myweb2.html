<h1> Filmmaking : <u>filming</u> , <u>recording audio</u> ---->  <u>mixing&editing</u></h1>
    
    <h2>History : </h2>
    <p>I might have had one dream job as a kid of working at movie sets, but my real interest in filmmaking started in 2015-2016. 
        <br>As I was training in parkour I used my phone to film myself during sessions, which helped me a lot to understand my training progress. 
        <br>Over time I kept filming more and more, and then in 2018 I started editing my first music videos, something which I still keep doing today.</p>
<p>From 2018 and on I found great passion for video editing and filmmaking, and started buying more filmgear(a few gimbals and a gopro)</p>
<p>And then in 2021 I undertook a course in <u>Documentary Filmmaking</u></p>

<h2 id="linkhead">I also have a link that used to go to my final exam of that course. A 15 minute-long movie.<br> Sadly the link does not work, probsbly since it is over a year old</h2>
